  \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
    This work focuses on the development of a 2D digital game in the Tron genre, aiming to deliver a playable prototype. The development process is organized using methodologies such as Scrum for project management, ensuring proper scheduling and delivery tracking. The Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) framework will guide the game design, ensuring a cohesive experience by aligning gameplay mechanics, player interactions, and aesthetics. Additionally, Rapid Prototyping and Iterative Design will be employed to test and refine the game prototype throughout development. This project applies software engineering principles, including agile methodologies and modeling strategies, providing a structured approach to digital game development while offering practical insights into the design and implementation processes.
